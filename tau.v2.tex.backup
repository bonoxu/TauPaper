\section{Introduction}

Many experiments, including the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP), has studied the tau lepton to a great details \cite{Schael:2005am}. The total tau lepton hadronic decay width depends on the strong coupling constant. The branch ratio of tau decay tau hence provides a precision test of the Standard Model and models beyond the Standard Model. The spin state of the tau lepton could be inferred from the decay product and can be used to measure the CP(the product of charge conjugation and parity symmetries) of the Higgs with a Higgs decaying to a tau pair channel.

%Tau lepton has been studied in the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) and other experiments and the decay of the tau provides a probe to the precision test of the Standard Model. The spin of the tau lepton can also be inferred from the decay product and be used to measure the CP of the Higgs decaying to a tau pair.

%Tau lepton is important. Good to study. It has interesting physics, spins, differentiating higgs to z. 

Final state separation of tau decay provides a good benchmark of the detector performance. The tau lepton has a very short life time and it will decay before reaching the calorimeter. The final states of the tau lepton decay mainly consist of charged particles and multiple photons. Separating different charged particle relies on the performance of the tracking system, whilst separating multiple nearby photons requres an excellent electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) resolution. 

%Final state separation of tau decay provides a good benchmark of the detector performance. The tau lepton has a very short life time and it will decay before reaching the calorimeter. As many of the final states of the tau decay consist of boosted charged particles with different numbers of photons and the ECal provides important calorimetric information for correctly reconstructing and separating nearby photons, this makes tau lepton decay final state separation suitable for the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) optimisation.

% The final sate separation is a good benchmark for the detector optimisation, as it tests the reconstruction of nearby photons, electron and muons. 

A previous study with the International Large Detector (ILD) in the context of the International Linear Collider (ILC) was performed \cite{Tran2016}, where the impact of the varying the magnetic field and the size of the ECal were discussed. It was shown that about 95\,\% \Ppiminus\Pnut and 90\,\% \Prhominus\Pnut and \Pai\Pnut final states were correctly reconstructed.

%A previous study with the International Large Detector (ILD) in the context of the International Linear Collider (ILC) was performed \cite{Tran2016}. Photons were reconstructed with GARLIC software package \cite{Reinhard2009,Jeans:2012jj} where the impact of the varying the magnetic field and the size of the ECal were discussed. It was shown that about 95\,\% \Ppiminus\Pnut and 90\,\% \Prhominus\Pnut and \Pai\Pnut final states were correctly reconstructed.

%It was shown that the ILD could separate the one \Ppipm hadronic decay final states with high probabilities.

% Previous study has been done on the ILD detector. Results were shown. Impact on B field and ECal sizes were studied.


The study presented in this paper was done using the CLIC\_ILD detector concept with the PandoraPFA software package . The CLIC\_ILD detector concept \cite{Linssen:2012hp} is designed for the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) based on the ILD detector \cite{Abe:2010aa}, with a Time Projection Chamber, and a Silicon and Tungsten fine granularity ECal designed for the approach of the Particle flow calorimetry \cite{Marshall:2012ry}.

% A new CLIC detector model is being designed with a Silicon tracking system in mind.

%Studied was done on CLIC\_ILD detector. CLIC\_ILD is designed based on the ILD detector, with a complicated tracking system including a TPC, a Si W fine granular ECAL aimed for PFA. A new CLIC detector model is being designed with a Si tracking system in mind.

In this paper, we present a study for the separation of tau lepton decay final states, as a benchmark for the CLIC\_ILD detector optimisation, by varying the size of the ECal cells and the centre of mass (c.o.m.) energy of the \Pelectron\APelectron $\to$ \Ptauon\APtauon interaction.

%We studied the separation of tau final states. And used it as a test of the detector optimisation, namely the ECal sizes and the c.o.m. energy of the tau. We present the results.

\section{Simulation and Reconstruction}

To obtain a clean environment to separate the tau final state, we used the  \Pelectron\APelectron $\to$ \Ptauon\APtauon channel. The main mechanism is the pair production of the \Ptau pair, via s channel. 

Simulated Monte Carlo (MC) samples were generated with the generator software WHIZARD 1.95 \cite{whizard}. PYTHIA 6.4 \cite{Sjostrand:1995iq} is used for the hadronisation and is tuned to the LEP results \cite{}. The interface to TAUOLA \cite{Jadach:1993hs} is used to describe the $\tau$ lepton decays. The initial state radiation (ISR) and the beam induced background were not simulated, but final state radiation (FSR) was simulated. This was because the study was perfrom as a benchmark study for the detector optimisation, and a clean environment is preferably to study the impact of the change of the design of the detector.

Around two millions events per ECal cell size and per c.o.m. energy were simulated before any generator level cuts. An event was considered if the event passes a set of cuts at generator level. The cuts are 
\begin{itemize}
 \item the final state photons not converting to electron pair in the tracking system,
  \item the tau leptons decaying in certain half polar angle region and
  \item the visible energy of the tau lepton decay more than 5\,GeV.
\end{itemize}

The half polar angle acceptance is 0.3 to 0.6 rad and 0.8 to 1.57 rad which cover the barrel and the end cap region excluding the barrel-end cap transitional region. The visible energy of the tau lepton decay is defined as the energy of the tau minus the energy of the tau neutrino. Again the cuts were chosen to obtain a clean environment of the interaction to study the effect of the different detector models on the \Ptau final state separation.

Events were simulated with software MOKKA \cite{MoradeFreitas:2002kj} with the CLIC\_ILD detector geometry description, based on the GEANT 4 package  \cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}. Events were reconstructed with ilcsoft version v01-17-07 \cite{Gaede:82475} and PandoraPFA version v02-02-00 \cite{Marshall:2015rfa}, where the photon reconstruction is described in \cite{Xu:2016rcz}.

The c.o.m. energy of the \Pelectron\APelectron $\to$ \Ptauon\APtauon channel were simulated at 100, 200, 500 and 1000 GeV. The same event was simulated with different ECal square cell sizes of 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 mm.

Seven decay final states of the tau lepton shown in table~\ref{tab:decay_mode} were studied, which cover 92.58\,\% of all tau decays. These final states can be classified into three categories: leptonic decays, one-prong with photons and three-prong with photons. The performance of separating charged particles is mainly testing the performance of the tracking system. The ECal design would have impact on the separating charged particles because of the association of the charged tracks to the clusters in the ECal. However, the difficulty of separating the hadronic final states mostly comes from the correctly separating nearby photons as a boosted neutral pion decays to two spatially close photons. An excellent ECal spatial resolution is required for reconstructing multiple nearby photons.

% We studied 7 final states of tau decays. This covers X\% of the tau decays. These final states can be classified into 3 categories, leptonic, one-prong with photons, three-prong with photons. The difficulty of the study mainly comes from separating final states within each category. Especially the separation of nearby photons as a boosted neutral pion decays to 2 boosted photons which are spatially close.

The analysis strategy is outlined in the following. First the detector space is divided into two halves using the thrust axis. Thrust is defined as 
$T = max_{\hat{n}} \frac {\sum_i \left| p_i . \hat{n} \right|}{\sum_i \left| p_i \right|}$, where  $p_i$ is the momentum three-vector of a Particle Flow Object (PFO), $\hat{n}$ is the thrust axis, a unit 3-vector that maximise the thrust, $T$. PFOs were then separated into two sets based on the sign of the dot product between the momentum three-vector and the thrust axis three-vector.

%Thrust is 1 for two back-to-back PFOs and 0.5 for a spherically symmetrical event. 

A set of discriminative variables were calculated for multivariate analysis.  Varibles will be described in order but they are all used for the multivariate analysis.

Number of charged particles were reconstructed correctly for over 90\% entries. As for number of \Pphoton and \Ppipm, there is a clear distinction between final states. For the  number of \Pphoton, more than half of the \Pem\APnue\Pnu has one or more than one photons reconstructed, due to the FSR photons.

The first of varibles separate final states into three categories: leptonic decays, one-prong with photons and three-prong with photons. The varibles are the number of reconstructed PFOs of \Pmupm, \Pepm, \Pphoton, \Ppipm, and charged PFOs. As shown in figure~\ref{fig:nPfos}, there is a clear distinction between different final states. However, there is still  a lot of confustion between final states with multiple photons, could be minimised using other information. There is some confusion between \Pepm and \Ppipm which will be discussed in the next paragraph.

%From table~\ref{tab:decay_mode}, each final state has different number of \Pmupm, \Pepm, \Pphoton, \Ppipm and charged PFOs.
%If all PFOs were constructed perfectly, which is unrealistic, these varibles would be enough to separate different final states. %However the confusion between different final states could be minimised using other information.

The next set of varibles are designed to separate leptonic final state from the rest, as both \Pmuon and \Pem final states have significant different topologies. \Pmuon deposits most energy in the muon chamber and some energy in the ECal. \Pem final state is separated using the distinctive electromagnetic shower profile in the ECal. The difficulty here is to correctly separate \Pepm from \Pmupm, where \Pmupm could start showering early in the ECal, which could be similar to a electromagnetic shower. \Pem\APnue\Pnut final state is separated using the distinctive electromagnetic shower profile in the ECal. The difficulty here is to correctly separate \Pepm from \Pmupm, where \Pmupm could start showering early in the ECal, which could be similar to a electromagnetic shower. Varibles of interests are $\frac{\sum_{i}{E_{i,ECal}}}{\sum_{i}{E_{i,tot}}}$, $\frac{\sum_{c}{E_{c,ECal}}}{\sum_{c}{E_{c,tot}}}$, $\langle{E_{calo}}\rangle$, $\langle{d_{T}}\rangle$, $\langle{Layer_{L,start}}\rangle$, $\langle\Delta{Profile_{L}}\rangle$, $\frac{N_{MIP}}{N_{calo}}$,  $\langle{\frac{E_{c}}{P_{c}}}\rangle$ and  $\frac{E_{\Pmu}}{E_{\Ptau}}$, where $E_{ECal}$ is the energy deposited in the ECal,  $E_{tot}$ is the total energy deposited in the calorimeter, $i$ is summing over all PFOs, $c$ is summing over charged PFOs, $\langle{E_{calo}}\rangle$ is the the average energy of a calorimeter hit, $\langle{d_{T}}\rangle$ is the average transverse width of a cluster shower, $\langle{Layer_{L,start}}\rangle$ is the average longitudinal start layer of a cluster shower, $\langle\Delta{Profile_{L}}\rangle$ is the average discrepancy of a  cluster longitudinal shower profile to an electromagnetic shower profile, $\frac{N_{MIP}}{N_{calo}}$ is the fraction of calorimeter hits profiled as minimum ionising particles, $\langle{\frac{E_{c}}{P_{c}}}\rangle$ is the average ratio of the energy and the momentum of charged particles. $E_{\Pmu}$ is the energy of the reconstructed $\Pmupm$. All variables have verg good discriminative power separating an electromagnetic shower to a hadronic shower by construction. The plots for $\frac{\sum_{c}{E_{c,ECal}}}{\sum_{c}{E_{c,tot}}}$, $\langle\Delta{Profile_{L}}\rangle$, $\frac{N_{MIP}}{N_{calo}}$ and $\langle{\frac{E_{c}}{P_{c}}}\rangle$ are shown in figure~\ref{fig:more_lep}, with c.o.m. energy of 100 \,GeV for nominal CLIC\_ILD detector model. From figure~\ref{fig:more_lep} $\frac{\sum_{c}{E_{c,ECal}}}{\sum_{c}{E_{c,tot}}}$ is above 0.95 and between 0.05 and 0.25 for \Pepm and \Pmupm final states respectively and $\frac{N_{MIP}}{N_{calo}}$ is below 0.3 and above 0.8 for \Pepm and \Pmupm final states respectively. Both are because \Pepm deposits most energy in the ECal and \Pmupm is minimally ionised in the ECal. $\langle\Delta{Profile_{L}}\rangle$ is below 0.05 for  \Pepm because only \Pepm will deposite electromagnetic shower. $\langle{\frac{E_{c}}{P_{c}}}\rangle$ is mostly below 0.7 for \Pmupm final state because \Pmupm XX


 T%he three varibles are $\frac{\sum_{i}{E_{i,ECal}}}{\sum_{i}{E_{i,tot}}}$, $\frac{\sum_{c}{E_{c,ECal}}}{\sum_{c}{E_{c,tot}}}$ and, where $E_{ECal}$ is the energy deposited in the ECal,  $E_{tot}$ is the total energy deposited in the calorimeter, $i$ is summing over all PFOs, $c$ is summing over charged PFOs, $E_{\Pmu}$ is the energy of the reconstructed $\Pmupm$, $E_{\Ptau}$ is the energy of the reconstructed $\Ptaupm$. $\frac{\sum_{i}{E_{i,ECal}}}{\sum_{i}{E_{i,tot}}}$ and $\frac{\sum_{c}{E_{c,ECal}}}{\sum_{c}{E_{c,tot}}}$ for \Pmuon\APnum\Pnut final state is between 0.05 and 0.2. $\frac{E_{\Pmu}}{E_{\Ptau}}$ is above XX.

Other variables have verg good discriminative power separating an electromagnetic shower to a hadronic shower by construction.

For \Ppiminus2\Pphoton\Pnut final state, there is a resonance of \Prhominus and it is used to identify \Ppiminus2\Pphoton\Pnut final state further. The varibles are $m_{\Prho,fit}$ and  $m_{\Pphoton1\Pphoton2}$ from the \Prho hypothesis test to find the best \Prho decay candidates by minimising chi squared,

Similarly, for \Ppiminus4\Pphoton\Pnut final state, there is a resonance of \Pai. As before, varibles are $m_{\Pai,fit}$, $m_{\Pphoton1\Pphoton2}$, $m_{\Pphoton3\Pphoton4}$ are extracted from the \Pai hypothesis test by minimising chi squared,

\begin{equation}

\label{eq:a1_reduce2}

%, listed in Table XX. Note that XX variables were specialised in separating a electron from a pion. XX variables were made to test the hypothesis of XX particles. The rho hypothesis is to find the best rho decay candidates by minimising chi squared according to $aa$, where X is all possible charge pions, Y is all possible 2 photons. The formula will reduce accordingly if there is 1 photon. Similarly, the a1 decaying to 1 pion 4 photon hypothesis is done in a same fashion with Chi squared function XX, , where X is all possible charge pions, Y is all possible 2 photons. The formula will reduce accordingly if there are 2 or 3 photons.

The particle identifications and all quantities were computed by the PandoraPFA. Energy of the $\Ptaupm$ is assume to be the same as the energy of $\Pepm$ beam, which is half of the c.o.m. energy.Recoil momenta were calculated assuming the \Pelectron\APelectron collision happened at the centre of mass energy. Both assumptions are largely valid when there is no ISR contribution. %The variables of energy ratios instead of the raw energies were calculated to make the MVA process more generic across different c.o.m. energies.

For the multivariate analysis, the multiclass class of the TMVA package \cite{Therhaag:2009dp} was used to train the seven final states simultaneously. The multiclass class is an extension of the standard signal-background classifier. For each final state, the multiclass classifier will train the final state as signal against all other final states as background. This process is repeated for each final state. The classifier output for a single event is a normalised number for each final state, where the sum adds to one. The number of a final state of a event can be used as the probability. The event is classified into a particular final state if the final state has the highest classifier output number. The advantage of using the multiclass is that the correction between different final states are accounted for and the classifier output are correctly adjusted for multiple final states, hence one event can only be classified into one final state.

Half of the randomly selected samples were used in the training process and the other half was used for testing. 

The TMVA multiclass classifier used is boosted decision tree with gradient boosting (BDTG), as it was found to give for the best performance. The MVA classifier is trained and optimised to give the best overall separation across all final states.

The reconstruction efficiencies for the seven final state of the tau decaying with c.o.m. energy of 100 \,GeV for the nominal CLIC\_ILD detector are shown in the table~\ref{tab:sel_example}.

The study was repeated with c.o.m. energy of 100, 200, 500, 1000 GeV. The ECal square cell sizes were also varied at 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20\,mm, whilst keeping the the total ECal size the same. The results table were are in the appendix X.

To compare the impact of the ECAL cell sizes and the c.o.m. \Pelectron\APelectron collision energies on the separation of tau final states, the selection efficiencies for various final states against the ECal cell size for different c.o.m. energies are shown in the figure~\ref{fig:pion_efficiency}. The leptonic decay selection efficiencies are not shown as they are similar across different ECal cell sizes. This is because the \Pe and \Pmu identifications mostly rely on the tracking system, which was not varied in this study. The energy deposited in the calorimeter are used for the assoication to the tracks but it has a small impact on the lepton identification. 

Overall, the hadronic decay selection efficiency decreases as the c.o.m. energy increases. This is due to the fact that when {\Ptau}s are boosted at higher energies, the separation between decay products is smaller. Hence it is more difficult to reconstruct multi-photon final states correctly.

As the ECal cell sizes increase, the reconstruction efficiencies generally decrease. Larger cell sizes have lower spatial resolutions, making the separating of nearby photons more difficult.

For the \Ppiminus2\Pphoton\Pnut final state, the selection efficiency for 500\,GeV rises from ECal cell sizes 15\,mm to 20\,mm and the one for 1000\,GeV rises from 7\,, to 20\,mm actually goes up as cell size increases. This is because when the algorithm can not reconstruct \Ppiminus4\Pphoton\Pnut final state, the 4\Pphoton are often merged and the event topology would be very similar to the \Ppiminus2\Pphoton\Pnut final states. Hence more reconstructed events are identified as the \Ppiminus2\Pphoton\Pnut final state.

For the c.o.m. energy of 100 and 200\,GeV, the selection efficiency of the 5\,mm ECal cell size is better than that of the 3\,mm. One possible explanation is that the  and the PandoraPFA have been optimised for the nominal ILD detector with the 5\,mm ECal cell size, which shares the same ECal structure with the nominal CLIC\_ILD detector.

\end{figure}

In order to compare the overall separation power of all the final states across c.o.m. energy and the ECal cell sizes, we constructed a single parameter function, the  \Ptau hadronic decay final state efficiency function, $\varepsilon_{hadronic} = \Sigma_{i} {Br}_{i}\varepsilon_{i} / \Sigma_{i} {Br}_{i}$, where $Br_{i}$ is the branching fraction of a final state after the generator level cut, $\varepsilon_{i}$ is the selection efficiency of the final state and the $i$ is summing over five hadronic decay final state of \Ptau. Leptonic decays, \Pelectron and \Pmuon, were not included as the variation of the leptonic decay selection efficiency is small.

In the figure~\ref{fig:hadronic_efficiency}, \Ptau hadronic decay final state efficiency, $\varepsilon_{hadronic}$, against the ECal cell size with different c.o.m. energy is shown. $\varepsilon_{hadronic}$ decreases when cell sizes increases and when c.o.m. increase.  Again, $\varepsilon_{hadronic}$ of the 5\,mm ECal cell size is better than that of the 3\,mm for 100 and 200\,GeV lines due the optimisation of the software fro the nominal ILD 5\,mm cell size.

The $\varepsilon_{hadronic}$ is above 90\% for the ECal cell size from 3 to 20\,mm for the c.o.m. energy of 100\,GeV. For 200\,GeV, the $\varepsilon_{hadronic}$ decreases from over 90\% to 86\% for the ECal cell size from 3 to 20\,mm. The degradation of the $\varepsilon_{hadronic}$ is significant for the 500 and 1000\,GeV lines, where the $\varepsilon_{hadronic}$ drops from over 90\% to 77\%  and from 86\% to 75\% respectively. 

For low c.o.m. energy of \Pelectron\APelectron $\to$ \Ptauon\APtauon, namely 100 and 200\,GeV, up to 15\,mm cell sizes of ECal will give a good performanace for \Ptau hadronic decay modes separation, where the $\varepsilon_{hadronic}$ is above 90\%. For the high c.o.m. energy, namely 500 and 1000\,GeV, it is preferential to have a small ECall cell size for \Ptau hadronic decay modes seperation. There is about 15\% degradation of $\varepsilon_{hadronic}$ for ECal cell size from 3 to 20\,mm.

%The degradation of $\varepsilon_{hadronic}$ is more significant for higher c.o.m. energy.

The paper illustrated the usage of reconstruction of the tau decay modes as a benchmark for the detector optimisation. 

%The high probability of correctly identifying the decay modes also showed the potential to measure the spin of the {\Ptau} with the CLIC machine.
